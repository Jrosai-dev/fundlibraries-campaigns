{"id":"campaign-9857","slug":"campaign-9857","title":"Books Beyond Bars: Bringing Hope Through Reading","short":"Help us bring books, literacy workshops, and library access to people who are incarcerated â€” because everyone deserves the freedom to read.","description":"Access to books can transform lives, but in many correctional facilities across the U.S., libraries are underfunded or nonexistent. With your support, Books Beyond Bars will. Build library collections of educational, vocational, and recreational books in underserved prisons. Host literacy and reentry workshops to prepare people for success after release. Partner with formerly incarcerated advocates to make sure programs are meaningful and accessible. Your gift directly funds book purchases, secure shelving, and stipends for educators leading workshops. Together, we can break cycles of illiteracy and empower thousands of people behind bars.","img":"https://fundlibraries.retool.com/api/file/9aa2dcf5-0424-403c-b476-5ab93131c66e","raised":0.5,"goal":1000,"category":"Public Libraries","location":"Mill Valley, CA","city":"Mill Valley","state":"CA","organization":"Open Pages Collective","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2025-12-12","created_at":"","updated_at":"2025-12-12","updates":[]}
