We also work to defeat legislation that violates our constitutional rights and infringes on our First Amendment right to access information.\n\nVALUES\n\nWe believe in the right to access information without discrimination.\n\nWe oppose censorship.\n\nWe believe that we must protect the constitutional rights of our students and citizens to freely access information and ideas.\n\nWe trust teachers and librarians to choose materials and provide free access to information and books.\n\nWe believe that parents, not the government, should supervise reading choices for their own children.\n\nWe support our public institutions and oppose any efforts to defund public libraries and public schools.\n\nWe believe North Dakota library collections should be inclusive and reflect the diverse citizens of our communities.","img":"https://everylibraryinstitute.retool.com/api/file/7421c5eb-0b5c-46ad-bd7d-f0abf373a119","raised":0,"goal":10000,"category":"School Libraries","location":"Bismarck, ND","city":"Public Libraries","state":"ND","organization":"Right to Read North Dakota","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2025-09-17","created_at":"","updated_at":"2025-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","updates":[{"slug":"righttoreadnd","date":"September 3, 2025","date_iso":"2025-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","content":"<p>This is an update</p>"}]}
