This 3,800 square foot building with around 5,000 served a population of around 10,000 people. Now, nearly 40 years later, our population has more than doubled to around 21,000 people, and we've crammed nearly 27,000 books into the same 3,800 square foot building! We've been incredibly fortunate to receive $3,000,000 in grants, municipal funds and private donations to construct a new 9,000 building, with a meeting room, computer lab and more, but we know those funds will be spent fast, leaving very little for new books. With $50,000, we can fill those shelves with brand new books, audiobooks, DVDs, homeschool curricula, games, puzzles and so much more.","img":"https://fundlibraries.retool.com/api/file/ae88f38f-0b46-42e8-a010-00f960ad21a7","raised":22,"goal":50000,"category":"Public Libraries","location":"Danridge, TN","city":"Danridge","state":"TN","organization":"Dandridge Memorial Library","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2026-10-07","created_at":"","updated_at":"2026-10-07","updates":[]}
