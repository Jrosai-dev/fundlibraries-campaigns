Pine Hollow County Library District wants to launch a new oral history and storytelling project to capture the voices of local farmers, teachers, veterans, and families whose stories might otherwise be lost. This campaign will fund professional recording equipment, transcription services, and training for volunteers to interview community members. The finished archive will be available both in the library and online, ensuring future generations can learn from and be inspired by the resilience and wisdom of Pine Hollow’s people. Your support preserves rural voices that deserve to be heard.","img":"https://everylibraryinstitute.retool.com/api/file/5edf3b28-2b30-46de-896c-23c159436830","raised":0,"goal":1000,"category":"Public Libraries","location":"Pine Hollow, MT","city":"Pine Hollow","state":"MT","organization":"Pine Hollow County Library District","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2025-10-28","created_at":"","updated_at":"2025-10-28","updates":[]}
