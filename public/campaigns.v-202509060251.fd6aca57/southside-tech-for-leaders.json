Many students rely on the library for research, homework, and college applications, yet lack the tools they need to succeed. This campaign will fund 50 new Chromebooks, upgraded Wi-Fi, and subscriptions to essential academic databases. Your support ensures that students in one of Atlanta’s most underserved neighborhoods have equal opportunities to excel academically and prepare for college and careers. By donating, you are helping us build a future where every student can thrive through access to the technology they need.","img":"https://everylibraryinstitute.retool.com/api/file/db12d7d9-8c2b-40ed-b24d-d3b6885c452c","raised":1,"goal":25000,"category":"School Libraries","location":"Atlanta, GA","city":"Atlanta","state":"GA","organization":"Southside High School Library Boosters","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2025-10-27","created_at":"","updated_at":"2025-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","updates":[{"slug":"southside-tech-for-leaders","date":"September 5, 2025","date_iso":"2025-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","content":"Hi there, this is an update!"}]}
