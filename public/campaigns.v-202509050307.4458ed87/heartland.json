{"id":"heartland","slug":"heartland","title":"Safe Shelves: Protecting LGBTQ+ Books in Small Town Libraries","short":"Help us defend inclusive collections under threat in conservative communities by funding locked display cases and staff training.","description":"In dozens of small-town libraries across the Midwest, books by and about LGBTQ+ people are being removed from shelves, vandalized, or hidden due to local pressure. Safe Shelves is a rapid-response project to help library staff keep these books accessible and protected.\n\nYour donation will fund clear locking display cases, signage affirming the right to read, and staff training materials on patron privacy and intellectual freedom. We’re starting with three libraries in Iowa and Nebraska—but your support can help expand this effort nationally.\n\nBooks should never be silenced. Stand with us.","img":"https://app.oneform.one/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Ijk0Y2E1NzAwLWIwOGYtNDU1NS04MTQ1LTgwMTMxZGU2ZmNkYiIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--2f706352627277b7e6c777b022847068a0a4d170/download-1.jpg","raised":0,"goal":4200,"category":"Public Libraries","location":"Kearney, Nebraska","city":"Kearney","state":"NV","organization":"Heartland Library Defense Network","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2025-07-18","created_at":"","updated_at":"2025-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","updates":[{"slug":"heartland","date":"August 26, 2025","date_iso":"2025-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","content":"text"}]}
