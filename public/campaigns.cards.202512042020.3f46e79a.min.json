This 3,800 square foot building with around 5,000 served a population of around 10,000 people. Now, nearly 40 years later, our population has more than doubled to around 21,000 people, and we've crammed nearly 27,000 books into the same 3,800 square foot building! We've been incredibly fortunate to receive $3,000,000 in grants, municipal funds and private donations to construct a new 9,000 building, with a meeting room, computer lab and more, but we know those funds will be spent fast, leaving very little for new books. With $50,000, we can fill those shelves with brand new books, audiobooks, DVDs, homeschool curricula, games, puzzles and so much more.","img":"https://fundlibraries.retool.com/api/file/ae88f38f-0b46-42e8-a010-00f960ad21a7","raised":22,"goal":50000,"category":"Public Libraries","location":"Danridge, TN","city":"Danridge","state":"TN","organization":"Dandridge Memorial Library","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2026-10-07","created_at":"","updated_at":"2026-10-07","updates":[]},{"id":"fight4thefirstlapeer","slug":"fight4thefirstlapeer","title":"Fight Censorship in the Lapeer District Library!","short":"Join your community's grassroots effort to keep censorship out of the Lapeer District Library.

The Marguerite deAngeli Library, generally considered the main branch,  completed in 1923,  was funded through a Carnegie Foundation grant. Our library system is overseen by a seven member board, and funded primarily through a local millage.Beginning in early 2023, a \"Requests for Reconsideration of Materials\" campaign was begun by a small group of vocal individuals  Challenged materials were books with LGBTQ+ themes and titles from the Fifty Shades adult fiction series.   Threats were made to defund the library by defeating future millages if the books weren't removed. All challenges were denied  by the library's Director and, on appeal, by the library's Board of Trustees.Since that time, individuals who previously supported these challenges have succeeded in being appointed to the LDL Board of Trustees, and are now trying to use those seats to restrict access to the same materials.  They have also stated publicly that the community may not support the next millage request if the materials are not restricted.Fight 4 the First Lapeer and \"Team 1923\" will defend our library and the right to freely access information for all members of our community.We sincerely thank you for your support, and hope you'll join Team 1923!","img":"https://fundlibraries.retool.com/api/file/85a118aa-9444-469d-a60a-e0862be9e58f","raised":891,"goal":1923,"category":"School Libraries","location":"Lapeer, MI","city":"Lapeer","state":"MI","organization":"Fight 4 the First Lapeer","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2026-01-31","created_at":"","updated_at":"2026-01-31","updates":[]},{"id":"erie","slug":"erie","title":"Keep Our Library Public!","short":"We believe that all of the Blasco Erie County Public Library belongs to the public!","description":"Keep Our Library Public (KOLP) has filed a legal complaint in the Erie County Court of Common Pleas to prevent 3200 square feet of Blasco Erie County Public Library in Erie County, PA from being leased to a tax-exempt, private, religious university.
