The Marguerite deAngeli Library, generally considered the main branch,  completed in 1923,  was funded through a Carnegie Foundation grant. Our library system is overseen by a seven member board, and funded primarily through a local millage.Beginning in early 2023, a \"Requests for Reconsideration of Materials\" campaign was begun by a small group of vocal individuals  Challenged materials were books with LGBTQ+ themes and titles from the Fifty Shades adult fiction series.   Threats were made to defund the library by defeating future millages if the books weren't removed. All challenges were denied  by the library's Director and, on appeal, by the library's Board of Trustees.Since that time, individuals who previously supported these challenges have succeeded in being appointed to the LDL Board of Trustees, and are now trying to use those seats to restrict access to the same materials.  They have also stated publicly that the community may not support the next millage request if the materials are not restricted.Fight 4 the First Lapeer and \"Team 1923\" will defend our library and the right to freely access information for all members of our community.We sincerely thank you for your support, and hope you'll join Team 1923!","img":"https://everylibraryinstitute.retool.com/api/file/85a118aa-9444-469d-a60a-e0862be9e58f","raised":765,"goal":1923,"category":"School Libraries","location":"Lapeer, MI","city":"Lapeer","state":"MI","organization":"Fight 4 the First Lapeer","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2025-09-30","created_at":"","updated_at":"2025-09-30","updates":[]},{"id":"letutahread","slug":"letutahread","title":"Let Utah Read - Stop Censorship in Utah","short":"We are a coalition dedicated to preserving Americans’ freedom to choose what we read.
