[{"id":"capecluborg","slug":"capecluborg","title":"Cape Club Organization Book Funding","short":"CAPE is a student-led 501(c)(3) nonprofit that creates and donates inclusive children’s books redefining representation in literature.","description":"At CAPE (Character and Pediatric Education), we believe children’s stories play a powerful role in shaping how young readers understand themselves and others. Many traditional children’s books quietly reinforce the idea that being different is something to overcome. CAPE exists to change that narrative by creating stories that affirm identity, emotional growth, and self-acceptance.This fundraising campaign supports the printing and donation of inclusive children’s books created through CAPE. Our primary goal is to fund the production of our published titles, starting with our debut book Feeble Franny, a story centered on embracing differences and redefining self-worth. Once printed, these books will be donated to elementary schools, libraries, and pediatric hospitals across our city and state, where they can offer comfort, representation, and encouragement to young readers.Beyond our core titles, this campaign also allows us to uplift the voices of other youth authors within our nonprofit. Publishing is often financially inaccessible for young writers and artists, and CAPE serves as a platform that makes it possible. With the funds raised, we will help print books created by our members, allowing their stories to reach classrooms, hospitals, libraries, and community spaces. In doing so, we amplify diverse perspectives while giving young creators real-world publishing experience and impact.We plan to begin fundraising in January 2026 and continue throughout the year. Our initial goal is to raise eight hundred dollars, which will allow us to print and donate approximately three hundred children’s books. As additional funds are raised, we will expand both the number of books printed and the number of youth authors supported through CAPE.By supporting this campaign, you are helping place inclusive stories into the hands of children who need them most while empowering the next generation of writers and artists. These books are more than stories; they are tools for empathy, healing, and change.","img":"https://fundlibraries.retool.com/api/file/5fded256-6dee-4581-90c6-993d46b880ec","raised":0,"goal":600,"category":"Public Libraries","location":"San Jose, CA","city":"San Jose","state":"AZ","organization":"Cape Club Organization","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2027-01-04","created_at":"","updated_at":"2027-01-04","updates":[]},{"id":"right-to-read-nd","slug":"right-to-read-nd","title":"Right to Read ND support","short":"RTRND is a nonpartisan group of North Dakotans who have come together in response to the growing movement to limit access to books.","description":"Right to Read ND was formally organized a few weeks before the 2025 Legislative session began in North Dakota this past January in 2025. We had very limited resources at our disposal, but we were determined to do everything we could to fight against a proposed bill that would have criminalized librarians and violated First Amendment rights in North Dakota.\n\nOur group tirelessly worked to rally North Dakotan citizens to use their voices and advocate against that legislation. We also helped facilitate a state-wide \"Read Out\" protest, where 17 different cities in North Dakota saw their citizens gather outside public libraries in opposition to the bill and to support intellectual freedom. Despite all this work, the bill still narrowly passed the North Dakota House and Senate, and would have become state law if it wasn't for a \"Hail Mary' veto from Governor Kelly Armstrong in April 2025.\n\nThough we won this round, we know we have a long road ahead of us in North Dakota.\nThrough this fundraising campaign, we hope to build more of an infrastructure for our organization. We would use the funds for administrative overhead, such as business cards, ad campaigns, and potentially reimbursing steering committee members for travel expenses next Legislative session, as North Dakota is geographically large.","img":"https://fundlibraries.retool.com/api/file/d4d0d7b4-2134-47e5-a708-7944da409b5f","raised":55,"goal":2500,"category":"Public Libraries","location":"Bismarck, ND","city":"Bismarck","state":"ND","organization":"Right to Read ND support","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2026-12-12","created_at":"","updated_at":"2026-12-12","updates":[]},{"id":"dandridge","slug":"dandridge","title":"Stock the new Dandridge Memorial Librarys shelves!","short":"Help fill the shelves of our new building with brand new books and other collection materials!","description":"Dandridge Memorial Library opened its first purpose-built library in 1986.

The Marguerite deAngeli Library, generally considered the main branch,  completed in 1923,  was funded through a Carnegie Foundation grant. Our library system is overseen by a seven member board, and funded primarily through a local millage.Beginning in early 2023, a \"Requests for Reconsideration of Materials\" campaign was begun by a small group of vocal individuals  Challenged materials were books with LGBTQ+ themes and titles from the Fifty Shades adult fiction series.   Threats were made to defund the library by defeating future millages if the books weren't removed. All challenges were denied  by the library's Director and, on appeal, by the library's Board of Trustees.Since that time, individuals who previously supported these challenges have succeeded in being appointed to the LDL Board of Trustees, and are now trying to use those seats to restrict access to the same materials.  They have also stated publicly that the community may not support the next millage request if the materials are not restricted.Fight 4 the First Lapeer and \"Team 1923\" will defend our library and the right to freely access information for all members of our community.We sincerely thank you for your support, and hope you'll join Team 1923!","img":"https://fundlibraries.retool.com/api/file/85a118aa-9444-469d-a60a-e0862be9e58f","raised":991,"goal":1923,"category":"School Libraries","location":"Lapeer, MI","city":"Lapeer","state":"MI","organization":"Fight 4 the First Lapeer","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2026-01-31","created_at":"","updated_at":"2026-01-31","updates":[]},{"id":"help-support-read-freely-alabama","slug":"help-support-read-freely-alabama","title":"Help Support Read Freely Alabama","short":"Our state-wide grassroots group needs your help to fight back against anti-library extremism and censorship","description":"Your generous donations go to fund our advocacy and outreach events, legislative initiatives, supplies, and technology/software to allow us to continue the fight against extremism in Alabama.","img":"https://fundlibraries.retool.com/api/file/2712ae5d-fde1-48f8-be5a-5eaa248ff3aa","raised":3343.5,"goal":10000,"category":"Public Libraries","location":"Mobile, AL","city":"Mobile","state":"AL","organization":"Read Freely Alabama","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2025-08-31","created_at":"","updated_at":"2025-08-31","updates":[]}]
