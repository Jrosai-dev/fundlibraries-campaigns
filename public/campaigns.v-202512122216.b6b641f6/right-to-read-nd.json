{"id":"right-to-read-nd","slug":"right-to-read-nd","title":"Right to Read ND support","short":"RTRND is a nonpartisan group of North Dakotans who have come together in response to the growing movement to limit access to books.","description":"Right to Read ND was formally organized a few weeks before the 2025 Legislative session began in North Dakota this past January in 2025. We had very limited resources at our disposal, but we were determined to do everything we could to fight against a proposed bill that would have criminalized librarians and violated First Amendment rights in North Dakota.\n\nOur group tirelessly worked to rally North Dakotan citizens to use their voices and advocate against that legislation. We also helped facilitate a state-wide \"Read Out\" protest, where 17 different cities in North Dakota saw their citizens gather outside public libraries in opposition to the bill and to support intellectual freedom. Despite all this work, the bill still narrowly passed the North Dakota House and Senate, and would have become state law if it wasn't for a \"Hail Mary' veto from Governor Kelly Armstrong in April 2025.\n\nThough we won this round, we know we have a long road ahead of us in North Dakota.\nThrough this fundraising campaign, we hope to build more of an infrastructure for our organization. We would use the funds for administrative overhead, such as business cards, ad campaigns, and potentially reimbursing steering committee members for travel expenses next Legislative session, as North Dakota is geographically large.","img":"https://fundlibraries.retool.com/api/file/d4d0d7b4-2134-47e5-a708-7944da409b5f","raised":0,"goal":2500,"category":"Public Libraries","location":"Bismarck, ND","city":"Bismarck","state":"ND","organization":"Right to Read ND support","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2026-12-12","created_at":"","updated_at":"2026-12-12","updates":[]}
