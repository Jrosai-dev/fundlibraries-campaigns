(Greatest Of All Trimmers)","short":"The Library  would like to obtain goats for our library  of things, to enable library  patrons to check out a pair of goats.","description":"The Anytown Public Library is thinking outside the book with its latest Library of Things fundraiser: goats! That’s right—soon you’ll be able to check out a pair of eco-friendly, four-hooved lawnmowers to help with brush clearing and yardwork. Studies (conducted chiefly by the goats themselves) show that one goat can consume approximately 3,000 weeds per day—though results vary if dandelions are in season. Please donate today and help us shelve some goats right next to the pressure washers and pickleball sets!","img":"https://fundlibraries.retool.com/api/file/ae88f38f-0b46-42e8-a010-00f960ad21a7","raised":0,"goal":1000,"category":"Equipment And Gear","location":"East Waterboro, ME","city":"East Waterboro","state":"ME","organization":"Public Library","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2025-10-30","created_at":"","updated_at":"2025-10-30","updates":[]}
