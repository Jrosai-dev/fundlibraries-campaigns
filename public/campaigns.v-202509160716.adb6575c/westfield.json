The Westfield Public Library strives to meet their needs, but resources for bilingual children are limited. This campaign will raise funds to purchase 2,000 new bilingual books in Spanish-English, Mandarin-English, and Tagalog-English, alongside storytime programming that celebrates cultural heritage. Every contribution ensures that children can learn in their home language while building English literacy skills, giving them the confidence to succeed in school and beyond.","img":"https://everylibraryinstitute.retool.com/api/file/877125fe-5256-47d4-ab69-fb662bf89921","raised":0,"goal":1000,"category":"Public Libraries","location":"Westfield, TX","city":"Westfield","state":"TX","organization":"Amigos of Westfield Public Library","status":"Active","start_date":"","end_date":"2025-10-06","created_at":"","updated_at":"2025-10-06","updates":[]}
